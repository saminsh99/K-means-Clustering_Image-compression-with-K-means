# K-means-Clustering_Image-compression-with-K-means
we will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.  we will start with a sample dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, we will use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors
